Description: 
To access and run the database:
1. Open the file "combinedAll.sql" and execute all lines.
2. Open the file "CMSC_461_Proj_1_3_Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb" for preview. 
Use Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab Notebook to access and test the database.

CombinedAll put db_first,createAll,dropAll, and loadAll together. To display different
